1. Why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

Arbitrarily doubling an array when there may be only a single collision may be overkill.
It would seem smarter to resize the array to a size more suited to how much new space
is actually needed. The amount of consecutive memory allocated for a new doubled Array
could start to burden the cache and require more calls to RAM.
