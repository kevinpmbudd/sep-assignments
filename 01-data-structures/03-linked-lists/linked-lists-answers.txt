1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

  Arrays are an example of when data is stored in consecutive memory locations.
  Spatial Locality more broadly refers to situations where data is used that is
  stored in 'relatively close' storage locations. Thinking back to when I used to
  de-fragment my hard drive it is helpful to visualize a collection of data that I
  want to access as a whole and imagine that all the bits that make it up are stored
  in scattered fragments across the hard drive. As I understand Spatial Locality and
  how it relates to performance the benefits come into play because of Caching. When
  a data is pulled from RAM to the Cache, it isn't just a single location pulled in
  but a 'range of locations.' So an Array benefits in performance because the array
  is stored in a consecutive range of locations and so it is pulled in together to the
  Cache.

2. Benchmarks Array vs. Linkedlist
